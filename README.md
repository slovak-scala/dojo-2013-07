 ## Basic info

 FizzBuzz game kata from [http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataFizzBuzz](Kata Catalogue)
 See comments on [http://www.meetup.com/slovak-scala/events/124420802/](Slovak Scala UG)

 ## Goal

 Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
 and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

 Sample output:

 ```1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16 ... etc up to 100```

 Variations, new requirements:

 1. A number is Wizz if it is divisible by 7
 2. A number is Fizz if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it
 3. A number is Buzz if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it

 Happy coding :)
